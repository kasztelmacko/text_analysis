Anytime you use Coda AI, we measure how much content is in the input + the output and convert those into credits. So if you have a huge block of text and ask for a small summary, your number of credits will be based on the large input + small output. If you have a small prompt asking AI to write a long essay, you'll have a small input + large output. And if you have a large input and large output, you'll add those lengths together to get your total credits used for that request.",

Most events in Lytics consume 1 credit, so the number of credits you need depends on how much data you send to Lytics. Inbound events refer to data received by Lytics from the web, API, or any managed integrations. They are consumed at a rate of 1 credit per event. For example, if you have 100 page views, it would consume 100 credits, assuming no additional data collection has been configured. All inbound events would consume 1 credit, regardless of how big the event is or how many profile attributes it updates. Cloud Connect sync events are a special class of inbound event and refer to rows synchronized between your data warehouses and Lytics. They are consumed at a rate of 1/2 credit per updated row. For example, if your query returns 1,000 rows, it would consume 500 credits. Subsequent syncs will only consume credits for the difference in records from the previous sync.",
                "Overages are handled differently depending on what account tier you are on: Enterprise: For our enterprise plans we generally do not charge per month style overages. We work with you to understand your usage and ensure you are on the right plan. If you are consistently over your credit limit, we will work with you to move to the appropriate plan at renewal. Growth: Growth plans which continually exceeded their monthly allocation will be automatically enrolled in a higher credit model at the rates outlined above. Developer: Developer plans which exceeded their monthly allocation will be automatically throttled upon reaching event caps. This throttle will prevent further credit consumption until the next billing cycle."

You add a new member 10 days into your billing period with 20 days remaining in the month. The per-day cost for each user is $8.75 divided by 30, so we\u2019ll make a one-time charge of $5.83 ($8.75 divided by 30 days times 20 days) to the credit card on file.",

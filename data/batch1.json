Anytime you use Coda AI, we measure how much content is in the input + the output and convert those into credits. So if you have a huge block of text and ask for a small summary, your number of credits will be based on the large input + small output. If you have a small prompt asking AI to write a long essay, you'll have a small input + large output. And if you have a large input and large output, you'll add those lengths together to get your total credits used for that request.",

The total cost when using multichannel is the single-channel cost multiplied by the number of channels. When you do not enable multichannel, Deepgram converts your multichannel audio into mono single-channel audio, and it is transcribed and billed as one channel. We especially recommend using the multichannel feature on multichannel audio in which there is cross-talk (voices overlapping or talking over each other) for the most accurate transcription and speaker detection.",

Most events in Lytics consume 1 credit, so the number of credits you need depends on how much data you send to Lytics. Inbound events refer to data received by Lytics from the web, API, or any managed integrations. They are consumed at a rate of 1 credit per event. For example, if you have 100 page views, it would consume 100 credits, assuming no additional data collection has been configured. All inbound events would consume 1 credit, regardless of how big the event is or how many profile attributes it updates. Cloud Connect sync events are a special class of inbound event and refer to rows synchronized between your data warehouses and Lytics. They are consumed at a rate of 1/2 credit per updated row. For example, if your query returns 1,000 rows, it would consume 500 credits. Subsequent syncs will only consume credits for the difference in records from the previous sync.",

We work with you to understand your usage and ensure you are on the right plan. If you are consistently over your credit limit, we will work with you to move to the appropriate plan at renewal. Growth: Growth plans which continually exceeded their monthly allocation will be automatically enrolled in a higher credit model at the rates outlined above. Developer: Developer plans which exceeded their monthly allocation will be automatically throttled upon reaching event caps. This throttle will prevent further credit consumption until the next billing cycle."

                "CRM pricing refers to the cost of implementing and using customer relationship management software. The price is determined by factors like number of users, features included in the software, integrations and level of support provided by CRM companies.",
                "CRM costs vary widely depending on the CRM company and features included. On average, the typical cost of CRM software ranges from less than a hundred to several hundred dollars per user per year, with some enterprise-level solutions costing even more. To find the best CRM software prices, research and compare CRM providers based on their pricing plans and features. Pipedrive offers different solutions at price points to match users\u2019 requirements.",
                "Pipedrive offers five main CRM plans: Essential, Advanced, Professional, Power and Enterprise. We recommend that you carefully evaluate your business needs and consider the features offered in each plan before deciding which CRM pricing model to choose.

                "Add-ons are additional Pipedrive tools that you can add to any plan. You are charged for add-ons per company, not per user.",
                "The difference is how often you pay your subscription fee. With monthly billing, you will be charged on the same day each month. With annual billing, you are charged once for the whole year.",
                "There are different ways to pay for Pipedrive including major credit cards, debit cards and PayPal. Your payment options depend on the country you live in.",

                "As well as the cost of the customer relationship management software itself, which differs based on pricing tier, some providers also charge users for implementation, setup, training, data migration, support and more. You may also be able to purchase credits to get access to more features or more access to the features already on your plan. Try to find a CRM that\u2019s transparent about its pricing. Pipedrive has no hidden costs, making it an excellent choice for anyone with a fixed budget.",
                "The cost of implementing a CRM varies based on factors such as business size, software choice, user count, customization and integration needs. On-premises setups usually have higher upfront costs. Some CRM providers charge users for implementation. If you choose Pipedrive, implementation is free when you sign up for a pricing plan that\u2019s over $400 a year. Costs differ widely, so a thorough evaluation is essential for an accurate estimate."
